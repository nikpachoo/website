description: "We chat with Roman Belov about the work he's doing at JetBrains with Kotlin for Data Science. We discuss the approach they're taking to work with the existing ecosystem as opposed to try and replicate it. How this is different from some of the other efforts under way and the direction in which they're moving when it comes to Data Science with Kotlin on multiple platforms."
