description: "We chat with Sergey and Max about their use of Kotlin in Space. We cover the frameworks that they use, some of which were born out of Space. We discuss their adoption of Multiplatform before Kotlin Multiplatform even existed, as well as why they chose Kotlin and the benefits it provides them, along with the main issues they encounter."
bio: "Sergey is Team Lead on Space and comes from having worked on ReSharper and Rider. Max is Project Manager in Space and comes from YouTrack"
