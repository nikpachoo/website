description: "We sit down with Jesse and Egor from CashApp (Square) to discuss how they decided to port OKio and OKHttp completely to Kotlin Multiplatform back when Kotlin wasn't even officially supported by Google. We discuss their ventures, reactions from the community, as well as some other things they're using Kotlin for on the backend."
