description: "We chat with Gaëtan about their work on data visualization using Kotlin. As one of the first pioneers of not only using Kotlin, but also targeting multiple platforms before Kotlin/Multiplatform even existed, Gaëtan talk about why and how they decided to first target JavaScript and JavaFX with their products."
bio: "Gaetan is an enthusiastic father, developer, entrepreneur, paraglider pilot… Having used lots of languages during its 20 years of IT experience, he believed very early in the promises of kotlin. He started in 2012 to code with it and in 2013 to promote it as a speaker."
